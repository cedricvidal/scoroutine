net.jimmc.scoroutine  v1.0.0  2010-09-04

A scala library to simplify writing coroutines and generators.

Download scoroutine-N.N.N.jar for the library jar file.
Download scoroutine-src-N.N.N.zip for the sources, example sources, and api doc.

To compile from the source, unpack the src zip file, then create a symlink
called "scala-current" in the created directory that points to the version
of scala you are using.  You must use scala version 2.8.0 or later, which
supports the continuations compiler plugin.  To properly compile the api doc,
you should use dev 2.8.0 as of about August 20 2010 or a later version,
which supports the "@constructor" comment tag.
